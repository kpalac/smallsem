Kneser–Ney smoothing, also known as Kneser-Essen-Ney smoothing, is a method primarily used to calculate the probability distribution of n-grams in a document based on their histories.[1] It is widely considered the most effective method of smoothing due to its use of absolute discounting by subtracting a fixed value from the probability's lower order terms to omit n-grams with lower frequencies. This approach has been considered equally effective for both higher and lower order n-grams. The method was proposed in a 1994 paper by Reinhard Kneser, Ute Essen and Hermann Ney [de].[2]

A common example that illustrates the concept behind this method is the frequency of the bigram "San Francisco". If it appears several times in a training corpus, the frequency of the unigram "Francisco" will also be high. Relying on only the unigram frequency to predict the frequencies of n-grams leads to skewed results;[3] however, Kneser–Ney smoothing corrects this by considering the frequency of the unigram in relation to possible words preceding it. 
Modifications of this method also exist. Chen and Goodman's 1998 paper lists and benchmarks several such modifications. Computational efficiency and scaling to multi-core systems is the focus of Chen and Goodman’s 1998 modification.[7] This approach is once used for Google Translate under a MapReduce implementation.[8] KenLM is a performant open-source implementation.[9]
